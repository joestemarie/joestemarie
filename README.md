I'm a developer, data scientist, and strategist, working on product and tech at [Bully Pulpit Interactive (BPI)](https://www.bpimedia.com/), a communications and marketing agency in Washington, DC.

A few notable projects that I've worked on at BPI:
- [Political Ads Tracker](https://politicaladstracker.com/), an interactive dashboard that tracks political ads on Facebook and Google to identify the key topics and targeting that shape some of the most important issues in the country.
- [Decibel](https://decibelcompetitive.com/), a platform that helps our clients understand public affairs and reputational advertising campaigns and understand how much they're actually moving the needle.

Outside of BPI, I've worked on a number of interesting projects
- [Sarah McBride's campaign](https://www.sarahmcbride.com/), where I've helped to lead some pieces of the campaign since it launched in 2019.
- [Reality Pollsters](https://instagram.com/realitypollsters), a project with my girlfriend to use surveys to understand how fans react to reality shows and visualize the results on Instagram and online. Since 2021, we've collected more than 30,000 survey responses about shows like Summer House, Real Housewives, and Survivor. [Check out our new interactive dashboard about Survivor](https://realitypollsters.com/survivor) and, if you're interested, sign up to take surveys on [shows you watch here](http://surveys.realitypollsters.com/s/Generic-Sign-Up/tt-07f09e?source=joegithub).
