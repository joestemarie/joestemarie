excerpt: Reflections on how AWS Lambda, Netlify, and the like are changing the way we build apps.

When I started to learn how to build apps a few years ago, before I could build any kind of meaningful backend, I needed to learn about server configuration. I had to understand relational databases. I had to understand how to set up a background task server. I had to learn how to set up load balancers in AWS. There are _much_ harder architectural patterns than what I built at that time, but it took a lot of time and patience to learn those things.

When I built this blog, I didn't have to think about the servers it was going to run on. All I did was write the code, upload it to the cloud, and behold: a fully functioning site.

It's important for people beyond developers to understand how this changes the game.

[Paul Johnston is really smart on this:](https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/1073348296066912259) "Serverless is about understanding when *not* to create technology."

But all of that is actually really irrelevant to the task at hand: creating an app to solve a problem. By abstracting away a lot of the configuration and infrastructure work, I can focus on the questions that are really critical: how do I make this do something really powerful? How do I make this really easy for people to use?

That change will seriously decrease the barrier to entry to build apps. That's a great thing - more people can build powerful tech that helps them take on bigger problems.
